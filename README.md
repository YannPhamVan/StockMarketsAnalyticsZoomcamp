# Stock Market Analytics Zoomcamp

This repository contains my work for the [Stock Market Analytics Zoomcamp](https://pythoninvest.com/course) organized by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/) and [PythonInvest](https://pythoninvest.com).

## 1. Course overview

The **Stock Market Analytics Zoomcamp (SMA)** teaches how to build end-to-end data and ML pipelines for financial markets — from data collection and feature engineering to model training, trading simulation, and automation.

It focuses on practical skills for **quantitative finance**, **algorithmic trading**, and **machine learning applied to time series**.

The course is free and open-source, created and led by [Ivan Brigida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-brigida-0b961319/).
